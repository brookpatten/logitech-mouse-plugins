# Logi+ Plugin to play with mouse haptics

Generated using [Logi+ SDK](https://logitech.github.io/actions-sdk-docs/Getting-started/)

Provides "Collission" haptics when mouse cursor touches a desktop boundary.  (seems like an obvious thing to include in a haptic mouse...)

Can be configured using [/src/package/events/extra/eventMapping.yaml](/src/package/events/extra/eventMapping.yaml)
